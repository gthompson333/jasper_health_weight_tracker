# jasper_health_weight_tracker

A Flutter app for Jasper Health to track a user's weight.

## Getting Started

Project Brief – Weight Tracker
Implement a simple weight tracker app using Firebase Auth and Cloud Firestore

Required Features:
-On first launch, the app lets users sign-in with Firebase – use anonymous sign-in for simplicity.
-After sign-in, the app shows a page where the user can:

Enter their weight into a form and submit it
○ Save this along with the current time into Firestore

View a list of all weight entries, sorted by most recent date. The app should update in real-time when data changes in Firestore. 

Bonus Features:
Edit an existing weight-entry 
Delete entries
Sign-out functionality

Notes
● Feel free to use dependency injection libraries such as Provider or get_it, if appropriate
● When building the UI and navigating between the views / screens, choose an approach that makes most sense in terms of usability
● Adding tests are not required for this project, but the final code should be testable

Submission
Please upload your project repository to Github or Gitlab. Your README.md should include the following details:
● Set up instructions
● Assumptions you made, if any
● Video of working application

Email repository link to aly.sivji@hellojasper.com. If you are submitting a partial solution, please include a brief explanation of what you could not complete and why.

Evaluation
Your solution will be evaluated according to the following criteria:
● The app works and satisfies the requirements outlined above
● General project structure and organization of the code
● Separation of concerns between UI, authentication, and database code
● Simplicity - we do not require an over-engineered solution
● Naming conventions for variables, functions, classes
Making the UI look nice is not required as part of this task - legible text and usable UI is sufficient
